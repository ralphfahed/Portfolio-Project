Results Summary

Core Functionalities Achieved:

User registration and login system.

Dynamic project creation, with multiple pages per project.

Global header and footer for all pages with toggle, logo, color, and size customization.

Editable page body with buttons, contact forms, text, and images.

Live preview and dynamic modification of page elements.

Comparison to Initial Objectives:

All main MVP objectives were successfully implemented.

Dynamic customization features met the goal of providing flexible content management.

End-user experience tested and found intuitive during development QA.

Metrics / Performance Indicators:

Number of successfully created projects/pages per user: unlimited.

Header/footer changes reflected immediately across pages.

All core features passed functional tests.

Lessons Learned

What Went Well:

Effective teamwork between two members, leveraging React, Python, and SQLite knowledge.

Agile sprint planning helped track progress and complete tasks iteratively.

Clear documentation in Stage 3 made development smoother.

Challenges and Solutions:

Managing dynamic page elements initially caused inconsistencies; solved by defining reusable components.

Integrating global header/footer changes across all pages required additional logic.

Improvements for Future Projects:

Allocate more time for QA and testing edge cases.

Use a more structured component library for faster front-end development.

Consider adding user feedback integration during development for iterative improvements.

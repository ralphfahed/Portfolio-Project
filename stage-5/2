What Worked Well:

Both team members contributed equally to development and documentation.

Clear task division helped complete sprint goals efficiently.

Improvement Suggestions for Future Projects:

Allocate more time for QA and comprehensive testing.

Plan for better component libraries to speed up front-end development.

Consider periodic feedback from end-users during development.

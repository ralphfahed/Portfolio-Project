3, Risks

Purpose,
To proactively consider challenges that might arise during the project and how to address them,

Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies,

Risk, Limited experience with dynamic page editors and React component state management,
Mitigation, Schedule learning sessions and allocate time early to experiment with components and live preview features,

Risk, Complexity in implementing save and load functionality for designs,
Mitigation, Break feature into smaller tasks, use local storage first for MVP, plan backend structure carefully,

Risk, Timeline delays due to unforeseen technical challenges,
Mitigation, Define realistic milestones, track progress weekly, adjust scope if necessary to meet MVP deadline,

Risk, Team communication issues since there are only two members,
Mitigation, Hold daily check-ins, document decisions in shared Google Docs, maintain open channels via WhatsApp or Slack,

Risk, Bugs or unexpected behavior during live preview,
Mitigation, Allocate time for testing, debug systematically, create a simple test plan for main features,

4, Develop a High-Level Plan

Purpose,

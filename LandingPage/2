Example:

"We wanted to create a tool that allows anyone to easily build dynamic pages for their projects without coding. Inspired by our own experience managing multiple project pages and wanting a flexible system, this project became a way to showcase both our skills and creativity. This is part of our Portfolio Project for Holberton School [link]."

Purpose,
To establish procedures for managing code, the development lifecycle, and ensuring quality.

Source Control Management (SCM)

Tool: Git with GitHub repository (https://github.com/ralphfahed/Portfolio-Project.git)

Branching Strategy:

main – production-ready stable code

development – integrates all feature branches before merging to main

feature/<feature-name> – for individual features or bug fixes

Process:

Commit changes regularly with descriptive messages

Pull requests required for merging feature branches into development

Code reviews by team member before approval

Merge development into main after QA and approval

Quality Assurance (QA)

Testing Strategy:

Unit tests for backend API endpoints using Python testing frameworks (e.g., unittest or pytest)

Integration tests to ensure correct interactions between front-end and back-end

Manual testing for critical user flows like registration, project creation, page editing, and live preview

Tools:

Jest for frontend component testing

Postman for API endpoint testing

Deployment Pipeline:

Staging: deploy development branch to a staging server for testing

Production: deploy main branch after passing QA checks

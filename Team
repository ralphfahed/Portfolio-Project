Initial Meeting

Our team held an initial meeting to introduce ourselves, discuss our strengths, and align our interests for the project. Both members have completed the courses provided through the intranet, which gives us a strong shared foundation in software development.

Ralph Fahed , Background in JavaScript, React, and Python. Strengths include frontend development, problem-solving, and project planning.

Abdalah Nana , Background in JavaScript, React, and Python. Strengths include backend development, debugging, and collaboration.

Since we both share similar technical skills, we decided to divide roles based on coordination and focus areas rather than technical gaps.

Initial Roles

Project Manager (Temporary): Ralph Fahed , Responsible for scheduling meetings, organizing tasks, and ensuring deadlines are met.

Team Lead (Temporary): Abdalah Nana , Responsible for guiding technical feasibility discussions and helping refine the MVP idea.

Both members will actively contribute to coding, documentation, and brainstorming, but these initial roles will help maintain organization during Stage 1. Roles may rotate in later stages for learning purposes.

Collaboration Tools:

Google Docs for documentation.

GitHub for version control and code sharing.

Trello for task management.

Decision-Making: We will discuss all ideas together and make decisions by consensus.
